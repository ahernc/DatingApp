When creating the member-card Component inside the members folder, it did not automatically 
add the MemberCardComponent declaration in the ngModule in app.module.ts
Also had to add the import manually at the top of app module
Bootstrap card 
Notice on the member-list html, the syntax for the member card and passing in the child component (the user)
    <div *ngFor="let user of users" class="col-lg-2 col-md-3 col-sm-6">
      <app-member-card [user]="user"></app-member-card>
    </div>

With Angular 9 use version 1.4L

L118:  Any to Any component communication for components without any direct relationship.
some important notes here: using the AuthService.  Then child components can subscribe to 
the property in the AuthService (for MainPhotoUrl).
Done using the BehaviorSubject. A type of Observable
Can be subscribed to
Subscrivbers can receive updated results
Subject is an observer (so we can send values to it)

Section 12: 
L124:  Reactive forms, as opposed to Template Forms
FormGroup -- tracks the validitity state.  Sounds similar to Validator using ViewState in MVC
validation is in component and not the template
Steps to adding a module.. 
1. declare the object in ts of the new type (e.g. FormGroup)
2. initialise it in ngOnInit (if applicable... e.g. with registerForm)
3. if the module is not already added, include it in app.module.ts (appropriate module should automatically auto include in headers)
4. change html to use syntax... 
Validator is included in framework
A custom validation is for checking matching passwords
