When creating the member-card Component inside the members folder, it did not automatically 
add the MemberCardComponent declaration in the ngModule in app.module.ts
Also had to add the import manually at the top of app module
Bootstrap card 
Notice on the member-list html, the syntax for the member card and passing in the child component (the user)
    <div *ngFor="let user of users" class="col-lg-2 col-md-3 col-sm-6">
      <app-member-card [user]="user"></app-member-card>
    </div>

Ordering of Use statements in Startup.cs is important

L111: 3rd party File upload:
https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-file-upload
With Angular 9 use version 1.4L
npm install ng2-file-upload@1.4.0 --save 

L118:  Any to Any component communication for components without any direct relationship.
some important notes here: using the AuthService.  Then child components can subscribe to 
the property in the AuthService (for MainPhotoUrl).
Done using the BehaviorSubject. A type of Observable
Can be subscribed to
Subscrivbers can receive updated results
Subject is an observer (so we can send values to it)

Section 12: 
L124:  Reactive forms, as opposed to Template Forms
FormGroup -- tracks the validitity state.  Sounds similar to Validator using ViewState in MVC
validation is in component and not the template
Steps to adding a module.. 
1. declare the object in ts of the new type (e.g. FormGroup)
2. initialise it in ngOnInit (if applicable... e.g. with registerForm)
3. if the module is not already added, include it in app.module.ts (appropriate module should automatically auto include in headers)
4. change html to use syntax... 
Validator is included in framework
A custom validation is for checking matching passwords

Section 13: Action Filters in Asp.net core
DateTimes now more user friendly
Tracking when the user last logged in.
TimeAgo pipe

ActionFilters can be added to Controller (e.g. UsersController), or at Application level.. whatever is appropriate

Had to add LastAction property to User 
 dotnet ef migrations add LastActive (make sure sqlite is not holding onto the table)
 dotnet ef database update 


S14: L140 PagedList
PagedList created

L143 
SPA: created interface paginations
in the userservice.ts: Observable of body, means you don't get access top headers.
we need access to pagination in the header... 
so updated the GetUsers method in userservicve
then update the member-list.resolver

L144
pagination from ngxbootstrap https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/pagination
used custom links content
https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/pagination#custom-links-content

https://valor-software.com/ngx-bootstrap/#/pagination#page-changed-event

IN the member=list html:
    [totalItems]="pagination.totalItems"
    [itemsPerPage]="pagination.itemsPerPage"
    [(ngModel)]="pagination.currentPage"
    (pageChanged)="pageChanged($event)"

component:
 pageChanged(event: any): void {
    this.page = event.page;
  }    

Don't forget .AsQueryable(); for subsequent queries

L147 adding the filtering functionality:

--------
Steps for adding classes, API, implementation of DTO using AutoMapper (for the Message class)... 
. Create class in API.Models
. Entity Framework: add the DbSet
. In DataContext: ensure method exists:
      protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder): 
    In this method, define the structure of the class... e.g. Many to Many, one to many is usually straightforwad, but many to many 
    needs a bit of code. For example:

            builder.Entity<Message>()
                .HasOne(u => u.Sender) // one person sends the message
                .WithMany(m => m.MessagesSent)  // One person can have a collection of sent messages, meaning one-many
                .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Restrict); // don't cascade delete

            builder.Entity<Message>()
                .HasOne(u => u.Recipient)  // each message can only be sent to one person
                .WithMany(m => m.MessagesReceived)  // a person can receive many messages
                .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Restrict); // don't cascade delete

. dotnet ef migrations add MessageEntityAdded (check the code. Ensure field names are correct. Ensure foreign keys defined correctly)
. dotnet ef database update: then check the database to ensure table created correctly
. Create DTO in API.Dtos if necessary: in this case, MessageForCreationDto
. IDatingRepository: add the methods needed... e.g.:
    Task<PagedList<Message>> GetMessagesForUser();
    Task<IEnumerable<Message>> GetMessageThread(int userId, int recipientId);
. DatingRepository: implement interface.  Leave not implemented for now.
  
         
. Create controller in API.Controllers. This needs to implement ControllerBase. Annotations:
   [ServiceFilter(typeof(LogUserActivity))]
   [Authorize]
   [Route("api/users/{userid}/[controller]")]  // change as necessary
   [ApiController]

. Standard imports tend to include:
using System;
using System.Security.Claims;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using AutoMapper;
using DatingApp.API.Data;
using DatingApp.API.Dtos;
using DatingApp.API.Helpers;
using DatingApp.API.Models;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;


. First 2 things needed in controller: 
    private readonly IMapper _mapper;
    private readonly IDatingRepository _repo;

. In AutoMapperProfiles:  CreateMap<MessageForCreationDto, Message>();
-- but importantly: Add the Reverse() method so it will hide the password Hash and Salt
  CreateMap<MessageForCreationDto, Message>().Reverse();
  
. ctor: 
      public MessagesController(IDatingRepository repo, IMapper mapper)
        {
            this._repo = repo;
            this._mapper = mapper;
        }


.Added a Helper class: MessageParams
.Then implemented fully the GetMessages method in DatingRepository
